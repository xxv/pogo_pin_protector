Pogo Pin Protector
==================

[See this on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3405196)

As an accessory to [this AVR ISP Pogo
Adaptor](https://www.tindie.com/products/nsayer/avr-isp-pogo-adapter-kit/), I
created a little pogo pin protector to prevent the pins from becoming bent.

The tolerances are pretty tight, so I had to ream the pin holes with a 1.5mm
screwdriver tip so that everything would line up properly.

Note: depending on how flush your pogo pins are, you may need to adjust the
`pin_height` variable in OpenSCAD. Ideally, you should measure from the board
along the pin to the center of the pin head. The pins need to be able to spring
to make a good contact, but the pin head should not be sticking out of the
protector.
